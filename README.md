Black History Social is website to learn and inform with other people about the history of African and African-Americans across the known universe. The content on the website is user generated and can be public knowledge or local knowledge about people, places, and events that may not be commonly known. You can think of it as a user generated encyclopedia built for users by users.

To install the app and properly use the app, you must download the repo and run bundle install to get all the neccesary gems and dependencies needed for the app to run. Run rake db:migrate and rake db:seed, to get the topics loaded. Once you have the repo downloaded, you can run rails s in the command line and go to http://localhost:3000/ to view and use it.
